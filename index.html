         <p><code>The Premier League, often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited), is the top level of the English football league system.</code></p>
         <p><code>The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.</code></p>
         <p><code>The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018–19 season average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181,[9] second to the Bundesliga's 43,500,[10] while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any league at 14,508,981</code></p>
         <p><code>Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).[14]</code></p>

         <p>Why do players take the knee?

            It’s a symbol of pride and identity.
            It’s about demanding change.
            It’s more than just a gesture.</p>
